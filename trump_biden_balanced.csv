"With uncommon courage and unfailing honor, Allied forces claimed the first few feet in the drive to turn back an empire born of hatred and prevent it from consuming Europe. They did it not for personal posterity or political gain, but simply because there was no other choice.",0
We will never forget what the conviction and mettle of those young patriots achieved‚Äîfor all of us.,0

We don't need to convince the American public that common-sense measures to reduce gun violence are a good idea. 2 in 3 people believe that we need stricter gun laws.,0
This is politics at its worst. We should all feel safe to walk the streets of our own cities and towns. Our workers should feel safe at work. Our students should always feel safe at school.,0
We need action. But the NRA and gun manufacturers have such a firm grip on Republicans in Congress that they refuse to consider common-sense gun reforms.,0

President Trump's Iran strategy is a self-inflicted disaster. Two of America's vital interests in the Middle East are preventing Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon and securing a stable energy supply through the Strait of Hormuz. Trump is failing on both counts.,0
He unilaterally withdrew from the hard-won nuclear agreement that the Obama-Biden Administration negotiated to stop Iran from getting a nuclear weapon. Trump promised that abandoning the deal and imposing sanctions would stop Iran‚Äôs aggression in the region.,0
"But they‚Äôve only gotten more aggressive. Trump also promised that walking away would somehow lead to a better deal ‚Äì instead, the predictable has happened: Iran is building back up its nuclear capability.",0
"It‚Äôs sadly ironic that the State Department is now calling on Iran to abide by the very deal the Trump Administration abandoned.

By walking away from diplomacy, Trump has made military conflict more likely. Another war in the Middle East is the last thing we need.",0
Make no mistake: Iran continues to be a bad actor that abuses human rights and supports terrorist activities throughout the region.,0
"What we need is presidential leadership that will take strategic action to counter the Iranian threat, restore America's standing in the world, recognize the value of principled diplomacy, and strengthen our nation and our security by working strategically with our allies.",0
